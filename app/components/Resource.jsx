// MPM: I'm thinking this'll be a dumb component that gets contained by / receives props from the goal / milestone / check-in ?
// OR, should this be a Resources component?  instead of receiving props re: an individual milestone, pass in all of them ??

// either way, the idea is that the user will input a URL, and we'll scrape that URL to render the resource "card"?
// a resource card should contain: title, thumbnail photo, and a description at the bottom
  // plus, it (the title and/or photo?) should be a linke:
  // have a click handler to redirect to that page / open in a new window?
